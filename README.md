# scottish.capital

This package contains data from each of the 5 two-year spans over which Scott and Hughes analyzed top Scottish companies for their book, *The Anatomy of Scottish Capital*, plus the affiliation network (`igraph` object) for each and some functions to reproduce the basic analyses performed.

Currently the data are known to be inaccurate due to directors going by different names.
